## Submission Description

## REST-section
With my submission I decided to push all of the files into the folder I had created using the index.js I had edited. I did this so that everything would be in one place

## Server-section
For the server I had difficulties using the regular windows command line so I used git bash in order to complete the assignment and get a screenshot. Which makes each command relativily hard to see the return of but if you look at the end of the statement you can see a "Recieved object" and then what was supposed to return
